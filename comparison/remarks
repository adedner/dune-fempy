1) ufl->hh in build directory doesn't help since it is needed in source
   so now one needs to copy the generated model header back to source dir
2) BoundaryWrapper is missing in generated model, i.e., now one need the
   virtualization or to copy BoundaryWrapper into the generated model from
   dune/fem/scheme/diffusionmodel.hh
3) constant<int> is not helpful, need the names (if available)
4) Coefficients in Model could be GF and the model stores ConstLDF<Coeff>
