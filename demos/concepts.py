# <markdowncell>
# # Grid Functions
# These are function that are defined over a given grid and are evaluated
# by using an element of the grid and local coordinated within that
# element:
# ```
#    value = gridFunction(element,localCoordinate)
# ```
# Alternatively one can obtain a `LocalFunction` from a grid function which
# can be bound to an element and then evaluate via local coordinate:
# ```
#    localFunction = gridFunction.localFunction()
#    for e in grid.elements:
#        localFunction.bind(e)
#        value = localFunction(x)
# ```
# There are multiple ways to construct grid functions. The easiest way it
# to use UFL expression. Many methods expecting grid functions are argument
# can also directly handle UFL expression.
# We can for example integrate a UFL expression over the grid:
# <codecell>

from ufl import SpatialCoordinate, triangle
x = SpatialCoordinate(triangle)

exact = 1/2*(x[0]**2+x[1]**2) - 1/3*(x[0]**3 - x[1]**3) + 1

from dune.fem.function import integrate
print( integrate(gridView, exact, order=5) )

# <markdowncell>
# and plot them using matplotlib or write a vtk file for postprocessing
# <codecell>

from dune.fem.plotting import plotPointData as plot
plot(exact, grid=gridView)
gridView.writeVTK('exact', pointdata={'exact': exact})

# <markdowncell>
# In some cases it can be necessary to convert a UFL expression into a grid
# function explicitly - for example to be able to evaluate it over each
# element in the grid:
# <codecell>

from dune.fem.function import uflFunction
exact_gf = uflFunction(gridView, name="ufl", order=1, ufl=exact)
mass = 0
for element in gridView.elements:
    mass += exact_gf(element,[0.5,0.5]) * element.geometry.volume
print(mass,type(mass))

# <markdowncell>
# Another way to obtain a grid function is to use the `gridFunction`
# decorator. This can be obtained from `dune.grid` but then without UFL
# support. Using the decorator from `dune.fem.function` the resulting grid
# function can be used seamlessly within UFL expressions:
# <codecell>

from dune.fem.function import gridFunction
@gridFunction(gridView,name="callback",order=1)
def exactLocal(element,xLocal):
    x = element.geometry.toGlobal(xLocal)
    return 1/2.*(x[0]**2+x[1]**2) - 1/3*(x[0]**3 - x[1]**3) + 1

# <markdowncell>
# we can use the same approach but with a function using global
# coordinates but can then be used like any other grid function:
# <codecell>

@gridFunction(gridView,name="callback",order=1)
def exactGlobal(x):
    return 1/2.*(x[0]**2+x[1]**2) - 1/3*(x[0]**3 - x[1]**3) + 1

lf = exactGlobal.localFunction()
mass = 0
for element in gridView.elements:
    lf.bind(element)
    mass += lf([0.5,0.5]) * element.geometry.volume
print(mass)

print( integrate(gridView, [exact,exactLocal,exactGlobal], order=5) )

# <markdowncell>
# As pointed out the `dune.fem` grid function can be used like any other
# UFL coefficient to form UFL expressions:
# <codecell>

print( integrate(gridView, abs(exact-exactLocal), order=5) )
gf = uflFunction(gridView, name="ufl", order=1, ufl=exact+exactLocal*exactGlobal)
fig = pyplot.figure(figsize=(20,10))
gf.plot(figure=(fig,121))
exactGlobal.plot(figure=(fig,122))

# <markdowncell>
# Converting UFL expressions to grid functions leads to JIT code generation
# and is therefore efficient when used in other C++ algorithm (like
# `integrate`). On the other hand using the `gridFunction` decorator leads
# to a callback into Python for each evaluation and is therefore much less
# efficient. An alternative approach is based on writing small C++ snippets
# implementing the grid function:
# <codecell>

    return a*(1./2.*(std::pow(x[0],2)+std::pow(x[1],2)) - 1./3.*(std::pow(x[0],3) - std::pow(x[1],3)) + 1.);

# The above is just one of a few ways C++ code snippets can be used
# together with Python code to improve efficiency or extend the existing
# binding to Dune. In the above example there is no advantage of using the
# C++ code over the code generated based on the UFL expression. For more
# complicated functions e.g. with many if statements or based on more
# information from the given element like it's neighbors the expressibility
# of UFL might not be sufficient or lead to hard to read code. In these
# cases directly providing C++ code (or Python code) can be a reasonable
# alternative.

# # Discrete Function Spaces
# Note that the grid functions set up so far did not involve any
# discretization, they are exactly evaluated at the given point.
# A special type of grid functions are discrete functions living in a
# discrete (finite dimensional) space.
# <codecell>

from dune.fem.space import lagrange as solutionSpace

# <markdowncell>
# The easiest way to construct a discrete function is to use the interpolate
# method on the discrete function space.
# <codecell>

# <markdowncell>
# On an existing discrete function the `interpolate` method can be used to
# reinitialize it
# <codecell>

# <markdowncell>
# Note that in the last example the Python lambda is used as a callback
# automatically using the same concept used in the `gridFunction`
# decorator. As pointed out above there are some methods where these
# conversions are implicit and no explicit generation of a grid function
# has be carried out.
#
# If a discrete function is already available it is possible to call `copy`
# to obtain further discrete functions:
# <codecell>

u_h_n = u_h.copy(name="previous")

# <markdowncell>
# Finally, `clear` can be called on a discrete function which sets all
# coefficient to zero and `assign` can be used to copy all coefficients
# between two discrete function over the same space:
# <codecell>

u_h_n.clear()
u_h_n.assign( u_h )

# <markdowncell>
# All the things we did above with grid functions can be done with discrete
# functions, e.g., evaluate locally
# <codecell>

localUh = u_h.localFunction()
mass = 0

    localUh.bind(element) # using u_h(element,[0.5,0.5]) also works

# or plot using matplotlib and write a vtk file for postprocessing
# <codecell>

u_h.plot(gridLines="white")

# and as before a discrete function can be used as coefficient in a UFL
# expression
# <codecell>

print( integrate(gridView, abs(exact-u_h), order=5) )

# <markdowncell>
# Note: the discrete function `u_h` already has a `name` attribute given in
# the `interpolate` call. This is used by default in the vtk file. An
# alternative name can be given by using a dictionary as shown previously.

# be changed without requiring any recompilation of the model. An example
# would again be in a time dependent problem a time varying coefficient.
# Being able to change the value of the time in the model without
