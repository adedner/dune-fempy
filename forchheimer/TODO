1) need to be able to set namespace or Model name within the ufl file,
   i.e., add a 'namespace = "Forchheimer" into the forchheimer.ufl file.
   This could be used both for the namespace and the headerguard
2) the Model class needs methods to set the constants without knowing the
   'numbers' required for the get method. These already exists for the
   integrands model and need to be also made available for DiffusionModel
3) actually include forchheimer.ufl in forchheimer.py (also explain that
   one could include forchheimer.hh)
