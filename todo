Things to do:

  Introduction - most important, might take up to a week, dune-python stuff? parallelism? what else should I put here?

  Header file - C++ section?

  List of features (grids, spaces etc) - how should this be done? just a list or some details?

  Elliptic equation - shouldn't take long, does this need changing?

  Touch up notebooks a bit - labels for images, some other stuff maybea

  make remark in mcf example that scheme is isoparametric with arbitrary order perhaps show in plot
  (level=2) perhaps use order=3 instead of 2

  add a gmsh example

  appendix with 'create' table

  appendix with grid construction

  get stokes example working again

  use Forchheimer example 'everywhere'?

  give as much modelling detail as possible in advanced examples

Might not have time:

  Extra sections - e.g. r-adaptivity, nonvariational stuff
