Things to do:

  Introduction - most important, might take up to a week, dune-python stuff? parallelism? what else should I put here?

  Header file - C++ section?

  Touch up notebooks a bit - some more detail to mcf

  Remove all the 'create.model' commands where the equation can be passed
  to the scheme/operator directly. Also use the df space in the forms and
  remove argument from scheme/operator construction

  make remark in mcf example that scheme is isoparametric with arbitrary order perhaps show in plot
  (level=2) perhaps use order=3 instead of 2

  add a gmsh example

  appendix with grid construction

  get stokes example working again.
  I suggest to remove all scheme from dune.fempy for now except 
  h1,dg,galerkin. Add a use of dg scheme to the 'scheme/operator' section
  discussed Tue 26/6 on paper to show the idea of having 'non code
  generated' schemes.

  give as much modelling detail as possible in advanced examples

  add something on compile time (possibly in section with the
  virtualization approach)

Remove import try/except in mcf (around pandas) - not needed for paper

Mention compilation times for the different parts of a dune-fempy script

Might not have time:

  Extra sections - e.g. r-adaptivity, nonvariational stuff
