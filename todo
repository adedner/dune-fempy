Things to do:

  Introduction - most important, might take up to a week, dune-python stuff? parallelism? what else should I put here?

  Header file - C++ section?

  Touch up notebooks a bit - some more detail to mcf

  make remark in mcf example that scheme is isoparametric with arbitrary order perhaps show in plot
  (level=2) perhaps use order=3 instead of 2

  add a gmsh example

  appendix with grid construction

  get stokes example working again

  give as much modelling detail as possible in advanced examples

Might not have time:

  Extra sections - e.g. r-adaptivity, nonvariational stuff
